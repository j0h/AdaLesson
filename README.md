compile a solution via `sh pandocify <ex-no>/solution.md`. You will need `texlive-xetex` and `pandoc` packages. That way you are able to use LaTeX identifiers like `$`.  
Please follow the folder structure.  
* A folder for every new exercise sheet
* A folder for every programming task within the exercise sheet
* Do not commit binaries. If we are not able to compile it, you did not document well enough.
* Every exercise sheet contains a `solution.md` which will be compiled right before handing in the exercise.
