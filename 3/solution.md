# Task 1

```Ada
type IntAccess is access Integer;
```
Pointer to an Integer on the heap. A simple access type cannot point to an
stack object.  

```Ada
type IntAccessAll is access all Integer;
```
Pointer to an Integer. Maybe on the Stack or on library (static) level. This 
kind of pointer provides *read-write* access.  

```Ada
type IntAccessConst is access constant Integer;
```
Pointer to an Integer. Maybe on the Stack or on library (static) level. This 
kind of pointer provides *read-only* access.
